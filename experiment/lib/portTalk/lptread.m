% Arguments:
% port - double Port address (e.g., 889 = 0x1 + 0x378 for status register of LPT1
% on many machines, which corresponds to pins 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 of a DB25
% parallel port -- note pin 11 is hardware inverted!)

% val = lptread(1+hex2dec(0x378));
% dec2bin(val,8) %the second argument uses leading zeros to keep bits in consistent locations
